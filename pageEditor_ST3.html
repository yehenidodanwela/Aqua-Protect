                <h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The Feedback Page uses semantic HTML5 elements to provide structure and improve accessibility. The navigation tag defines the top navigation bar and includes links to various sections of the site. The header introduces the page with a clear heading that describes its purpose. The main section contains the feedback form, enhancing SEO and logical page structure. The form is built using fieldset and legend elements to group related inputs and improve usability. Labels are linked to their respective input fields, making the form accessible to screen readers. The form includes various input types such as text fields, textareas for longer responses, select dropdowns for predefined choices, and a submit button for interaction. CSS styling is applied to center the form and create a modern, clean appearance. Properties like box-shadow, border-radius, and padding enhance the visual appeal. All input elements are styled to have consistent width and rounded borders. The button includes hover and click effects for smooth interactions. The navigation bar and footer are styled using flexbox to ensure even spacing and alignment across the page.</p> 
                    
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>Accessibility was a key consideration in building the Feedback Page. Semantic HTML elements such as header, nav, main, fieldset, legend, and footer were used to structure the content clearly. Labels are properly linked to their corresponding input fields, ensuring that screen readers can easily interpret the form. All form inputs, buttons, and navigation links can be accessed using a keyboard. The logical ordering of form elements allows for smooth navigation with the Tab key. Input fields are enhanced with required attributes and validation patterns, reducing errors and guiding users to complete the form correctly. Title attributes offer additional instructions, and sufficient color contrast is maintained between text and background for readability. All icons and logos include descriptive alt text to support screen reader users.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 id="team">Our Team</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The Team Page wraps all content inside a main container for semantic clarity. A central heading and introductory paragraph describe the purpose of the section. Team members are displayed inside individual content boxes styled as cards, using a flexbox layout to create a responsive grid. Each card contains a profile image and short biography. The design uses a white background with soft shadows and rounded corners to create a clean, professional look. On hover, the team member cards expand slightly using a scale transform to enhance interactivity. Images within the cards are styled using object-fit to maintain proportion and ensure they fill the space without distortion. Media queries adjust the layout for smaller screen sizes by reducing box sizes and stacking cards in a single column. Fonts and colors are chosen to be consistent with the rest of the site design, ensuring a cohesive user experience.</p> 

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>The Team Page uses semantic headings to establish a clear structure for screen readers. Each team member's image is accompanied by descriptive alt text. Navigation links and interactive elements are accessible by keyboard and include focus indicators. The "Back to Top" button is operable with a keyboard and clearly visible. Text colors and backgrounds were selected for high contrast and readability. While additional team details appear on hover, enhancements such as buttons could be added for users who cannot use hover actions. The layout adjusts automatically for smaller devices, improving usability on all screen sizes. Descriptive link text avoids vague labels and helps all users understand navigation options.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 id="content">Content Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The Content Page includes a toggleable sidebar for internal navigation. This is achieved using a hidden checkbox element and styled labels that act as open and close buttons. The sidebar contains anchor links to help users jump between specific sections of the content. The main content is organized using clear sectioning with headings, paragraphs, and lists to maintain readability. The page makes use of content cards to present information visually. Each card includes an image, heading, and description, styled with shadows and hover effects to create a dynamic interface. Flexbox and grid layouts are used throughout to arrange content evenly and ensure responsiveness. Background images are applied to hero sections and cards to enhance visual impact. Buttons are styled with clear colors and hover states. Responsive design is ensured using media queries and flexible sizing units, making the layout adaptable to various screen sizes.</p> 

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>The Content Page ensures high contrast between text and background for visual clarity. Fonts such as Baloo 2 are used for readability, and sizes are scaled using rem units for consistent rendering. The viewport meta tag enables scaling on different devices, and flexible units like percentages and vh allow responsive resizing. Internal navigation links are clearly labeled and avoid vague phrases like "click here." Lists are structured for screen reader compatibility, and content is grouped into clear sections with headings and paragraphs. Keyboard navigation is supported, and interactive elements such as cards and buttons provide visible feedback. Though the page is mostly accessible, adding ARIA attributes could further enhance support for assistive technologies.</p>

                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                    <p>Creating these pages came with several challenges. One of the key difficulties was making the SVG-based sitemap responsive. By using attributes such as viewBox and preserveAspectRatio, this was resolved. Another challenge was achieving consistent visual design across pages created by multiple contributors. A shared CSS file helped to unify fonts, colors, and layouts. Accessibility was another focus area. Initially, some elements lacked labels or proper focus states, but these were corrected through testing with screen readers and adjusting styles. Compliance with GDPR and copyright policies also required close attention, especially when selecting images and writing content. These challenges taught the importance of early testing, documentation, responsive design principles, and clear communication within the team.</p>

                <h2 id="compliance"> Compliance</h2>
                    <p>The Feedback, Team, and Content pages all comply with Janet regulations by adhering to key standards in data protection, accessibility, and cybersecurity. The Feedback Page limits data collection to necessary fields, includes validation, and provides user guidance while maintaining privacy. The Team Page uses only licensed or original images and avoids collecting personal information, ensuring copyright compliance. The Content Page avoids copyrighted material, fact-checks all information, and maintains a clear and readable layout. All pages follow Web Content Accessibility Guidelines to ensure compatibility with screen readers and keyboard navigation. Cybersecurity is addressed by validating inputs and avoiding vulnerable third-party scripts. HTTPS is used to secure data transmission. Challenges encountered during development were resolved through testing, teamwork, and attention to accessibility, performance, and legal compliance.</p>
